To make this implementation of Ivector work you have to first download the dependent toolbox from microsoft website. 
1. To download the toolbox : Google MSR Identity Toolbox, The first link will direct you to the toolbox download on microsoft's website.
2. Then extract that toolbox into your MATLAB Directory and put this Ivector UBM code in that directory as well.
3. Just run this file, you will get a confusion matrix and vectors X and Y (if you type them) which represents the data points on the ROC curve.
4. Which is what is already plotted for you in the ivector_ROC.png file.
